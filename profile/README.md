## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains tools and scripts for analyzing climate-induced migration patterns using remote sensing and Earth observation data. The project leverages geospatial analysis and social data integration to identify and map migration drivers influenced by climate events.

### ✨ Key Features:

- 🛰️ Remote sensing analysis for environmental drivers (e.g., drought, floods, land cover changes)
- 📊 Social media/CDR analysis to understand migration patterns and integration
- ✅ Data quality assessments and validation methods

## 🌿 Impact Chain: Climate-Induced Migration

- 🌱 **Climate drivers** cause shifts in ecosystems.
- 🏡 **Populations in affected areas** experience impacts on livelihoods, homes, and resources.
- 📉 **Vulnerability factors** like poverty, dependence on natural resources, and land cover changes amplify risks.
- 🚫 **Limited adaptation capacity** due to poor infrastructure, financial constraints, and governance gaps.
- 🧳 **Migration** emerges as a necessary response to escape deteriorating conditions.
