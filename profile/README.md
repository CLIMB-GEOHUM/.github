## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains tools and scripts for analyzing climate-induced migration patterns using remote sensing and Earth observation data. The project leverages geospatial analysis and social data integration to identify and map migration drivers influenced by climate events.

### ✨ Key Features:

- 🛰️ Remote sensing analysis for environmental drivers (e.g., drought, floods, land cover changes)
- 📊 Social media/CDR analysis to understand migration patterns and integration
- ✅ Data quality assessments and validation methods

Climate drivers cause shifts in ecosystems
Populations living in affected areas experience direct impacts on their livelihoods, homes, and resources.
Poverty, dependence on natural resources, and changes in land cover, amplify their vulnerability.
Limited access to infrastructure, financial resources, and governance support struggle to adapt to these changes.
Migration becomes a necessary response to escape deteriorating living conditions.

## 🌿 Impact Chain: Climate-Induced Migration

- 🌱 **Climate drivers** cause shifts in ecosystems.
- 🏡 **Populations in affected areas** experience impacts on livelihoods, homes, and resources.
- 📉 **Vulnerability factors** like poverty, dependence on natural resources, and land cover changes amplify risks.
- 🚫 **Limited adaptation capacity** due to poor infrastructure, financial constraints, and governance gaps.
- 🧳 **Migration** emerges as a necessary response to escape deteriorating conditions.
